## Introduction to the project

The project involves developing an application that can predict future price fluctuations of commodities, considering variables such as climate, location, temperature, season, previous prices, type, and humidity. By training the AI with historical data, it will be able to identify patterns and forecast future price changes in commodities.

**Project Description**

Our goal is to create a sophisticated AI-driven application designed to analyze and predict future variations in commodity prices. The predictive model will leverage a range of data inputs, including:

- Climate Data: Information on weather patterns, including precipitation and temperature variations.
- Geographical Location: Data on the specific areas where commodities are grown or produced.
- Seasonal Trends: Insights into how different times of the year affect commodity prices.
- Historical Prices: Past price data to identify trends and patterns over time.
- Commodity Type: Specific characteristics of the commodity in question.
- Humidity Levels: Impact of moisture content on commodity storage and pricing.

 By integrating these diverse data sources, our AI will learn from historical trends and use this knowledge to predict future price movements with increased accuracy.

**Benefits**

_For Farmers and Producers_


- Enhanced Sales Management: With access to accurate price forecasts, farmers and producers can better plan their sales strategies. They can decide the best times to sell their products to maximize profits and reduce losses.

- Resource Allocation: Knowing future price trends allows farmers to allocate resources more efficiently, whether it's deciding when to plant, harvest, or invest in storage facilities.

- Risk Mitigation: Predictive insights can help farmers hedge against potential market risks, such as price drops due to overproduction or adverse weather conditions.


_For Consumers and Businesses_


- Cost Savings: Consumers, including businesses, can make informed decisions about when to purchase commodities. By buying when prices are expected to be lower, they can achieve significant cost savings.

- Budget Planning: Businesses can forecast their expenses more accurately, leading to better financial planning and management.

- Supply Chain Optimization: Companies involved in the supply chain can optimize their operations by anticipating price changes, ensuring they buy raw materials at the most cost-effective times.

_For Investors and Traders_


- Market Analysis: Investors and commodity traders can use the application to gain a competitive edge in the market. Accurate predictions allow for better-informed investment decisions.

- Portfolio Management: By understanding future price movements, investors can better manage their portfolios, balancing risk and reward.
For Policymakers and Researchers

- Economic Planning: Governments and policymakers can use the data to understand market trends and make informed decisions about subsidies, import/export regulations, and other economic policies.

- Research and Development: Researchers can utilize the data and predictions to study market dynamics, agricultural trends, and the impact of climate change on commodity prices.

## How to Run in Production Mode

To run the application in production mode, follow these detailed steps:

### Step 1: Build the Application

1. **Navigate to the Project Repository**
   - Open your terminal and navigate to the project repository directory using the `cd` command.

2. **Build the Application**
   ```bash
   cartesi build```

- Explanation: This command compiles and prepares the application for deployment. It processes all the necessary files and dependencies to ensure the application is ready to run. This step is crucial as it ensures that the application is optimized and free from any development-specific configurations.

**Step 2: Run the Application**

1 - run 
```cartesi run
```

- Explanation: This command starts the application server. It initializes all the necessary services and endpoints required for the application to function. Running the application in this mode ensures that it operates in an environment similar to production, allowing for thorough testing and validation.


**Step 3: Open a Second Terminal**

1 - Explanation: You need two separate terminal windows to operate the server and interact with it. The first terminal is dedicated to running the server (cartesi run), while the second terminal will be used to send commands and interact with the server.


**Step 4: Send Generic Command**

1 - _Open a New Terminal and Navigate to the Project Repository_

Use the cd command to navigate to the project repository in the second terminal.


2 - _Send the Generic Command_

```cartesi send generic
```

- Explanation: This command is used to interact with the running server by sending data or requests. This is essential for performing operations like querying data or sending inputs.

  3 - _Follow the Prompts_

- Chain: Select Foundry.

- RPC URL: Choose the provided RPC URL option (this URL is specific to the running server).

- Wallet: Select Mnemonic.

- Mnemonic: Follow the prompts to input the mnemonic options.

- Input String: Choose encoding.

_Example Input Data:_

```temperature: [your chosen temperature]
region: [your chosen region]
type of commodity: [your chosen commodity type]
```

_4 - Receive Confirmation_

- After sending the data, you will receive a confirmation message:

```Input sent: 0xe2a2ba347659e53c53f3089ff3268255842c03bafbbf185375f94c7a78f3f98a
```

**Step 5: Check the Output**

_1 - Return to the First Terminal_

Go back to the first terminal window where the server is running.

_2 - View the Response_

In this terminal, you will see the output of the data you sent. The server processes the input and provides the necessary response or output.

- By following these steps, you can successfully run the application in production mode and interact with it effectively. Make sure to follow each step carefully to ensure proper setup and operation.
